  <h2>Before the Wyrm</h2> <!-- subtitulo -->

  <p>Long before the Kingdom of Hallownest was founded, an ancient civilisation
     existed in its place. Instead of worshipping any power or lord, this civilisation
     worshipped the Void, a substance which is found at the bottom of the Abyss.
      Due to unknown causes, the ancient civilisation eventually disappeared.</p>

    <p> The ancient enemy of the Void was the Radiance, a higher being who is a light brighter
      than Essence and who has some power over the Dream Realm. She created the moth
     tribe who in turn worshipped her. Several other tribes existed as well, such as the Mosskin,
      the Mantis Tribe, and the spider tribe.

  <h2>The Kingdom of Hallownest</h2> <!-- subtitulo -->

  <p>At a certain point in time, a Wyrm arrived in Kingdom's Edge where it shed its shell.
    This Wyrm then transformed into the Pale King in order to match the form of the other,
    lesser bugs. Similar to the Radiance, the Pale King was a higher being who was known
    as a light.He expanded the minds of several species of bugs in Hallownest,
    which granted them sapience, and in return the Pale King expected them to worship him</p>

  <p>The Kingdom of Hallownest was founded, which the Pale King ruled as a god-king
    together with his Queen, the White Lady. The Radiance's moth tribe turned its back
    on her, choosing to worship the Pale King instead. Parts of Greenpath which used
    to belong to the Mosskin were annexed, while the Mushroom Clan of the Fungal Wastes
    accepted the Pale King's rule willingly.</p>

  <p>The Mantis Tribe and the bugs of Hallownest had no love for each other,
    but they agreed on a truce where the Mantises would keep the beasts of Deepnest
    at bay. The Bees of the Hive and the spider tribe of Deepnest chose to remain
    separate from the kingdom.</p>

    <p> The Pale King ruled Hallownest from his palace far below the Kingdom.
      Under his reign, the kingdom flourished, with many travellers coming and going.
     The capital of Hallownest was located above the King's palace and was the destination
      of many pilgrims. The Five Great Knights served as the kingdom's protectors.

    <h2>The Infection and the Hollow Knight</h2> <!-- subtitulo -->

      <figcaption> The pale King taking the Hollow Knight out of the Abyss</figcaption></fig3> <!-- texto pequeño de caption de imagen-->

    <p>With the Moth Tribe no longer worshiping the Radiance, she was almost
       entirely forgotten. However, remnants of her memory still lingered,
       such as the statue on Hallownest's Crown. When she attempted to make bugs
        remember her again through their dreams, they resisted her influence,
        which manifested itself as the Infection.</p>

    <p>To put a stop to the Infection, the Pale King decided to seal the Radiance
      away in a Vessel with no mind nor will. This would make the Radiance unable
       to influence them and thus leave her trapped forever. These Vessels were
       the children of the Pale King and the White Lady, born in the Abyss with
       Void filling their shells.</p>

    <p>After many Vessels were discarded for having a mind and will,
       one Vessel was considered pure and chosen to seal the Radiance. This
       Vessel was taken out of the Abyss and named the Hollow Knight, trained
        and raised in the White Palace.</p>

    <p>Three bugs were asked to become Dreamers, which would put them in an
      eternal sleep and seal the Temple of the Black Egg where the Hollow Knight
     and the Radiance would be contained. Herrah the Beast, the queen of
      Deepnest,[63] only accepted if the Pale King would give her a child.
       This child ended up being Hornet, born of Herrah and the Pale King.</p>

      <p> When the Hollow Knight was fully grown, they were sealed together
        with the Radiance within the Temple of the Black Egg. The three Dreamers
        went to sleep to protect the Black Egg's entrance. Two monuments were built
        in remembrance of their sacrifice, one dedicated to the Hollow Knight in the
        capital city, and one dedicated to the Dreamers in the Resting Grounds.

    <h2>The Fall of the Kingdom</h2> <!-- subtitulo -->

   <p>After some time, it became clear that the Hollow Knight was not a pure Vessel,
      tarnished by their bond with the Pale King who raised them. Due to this,
      the Radiance was eventually able to exert influence again, causing the Infection
      to reappear.</p>

        <figcaption> The Hollow Knight in the opening cutscene</figcaption></fig3> <!-- texto pequeño de caption de imagen-->

  <p>As the kingdom fell to ruin, the Pale King abandoned the bugs of Hallownest
     and disappeared together with the White Palace. Most of Hallownest's
    inhabitants became infected or died, with a few exceptions such as the
      Mantis tribe and some other bugs who resisted the Infection.</p>

    <p>The Radiance eventually managed to break out of the Hollow Knight,
      cracking their shell and fully infecting them. This event prompted the
       Knight to return to Hallownest, the kingdom now overrun by the reanimated
       corpses of its former citizens.
